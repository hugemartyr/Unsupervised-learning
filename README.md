# K-Means Clustering with PCA

This project performs unsupervised feature extraction and data segmentation using PCA and K-Means clustering.

## Features:
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Manual implementation of K-Means clustering
- Evaluation using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
- Visualization of clustering results

## Usage:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

Clustering results will be saved in the `results/plots/` folder.
